Transcript:
(00:01) as many of you have already noticed with Tailwind CSS version 4 there is no Tailwind doc config.js file anymore instead you can now configure all your customizations directly in the CSS file according to the creator of tawin CSS this is one of the biggest changes with version 4 so it's very likely that it will affect you and that you need to learn about this new CSS first approach if you want to keep using telwin CSS in the future in previous versions of Tailwind the Tailwind doc config.
(00:36) js file was where you handled all configurations for most projects this file probably looked something like this with a Content section where you list all your content files a theme section for customization as well as a plugin section for importing your plugins and maybe also some options like dark modes and prefix but since the Tailwind doc config.
(01:00) js file was removed with the release of version 4 at least by default here's what you need to know and how things work with the new version I'll cover the four main or most common sections of the Tailwind doc config.js file and I'll talk about the theme section last because it's the most extensive part so let's start with the content section this is where you used to configure the path to all of your HTML templates JavaScript components and any other files that contain tail Tailwind class names but with Tailwind version 4 this is now fully automated that means
(01:35) that Tailwind detects all of this automatically so you no longer need to configure it yourself the plugins section in tailent version three this section allows you to register plugins with Tailwind that can be used to generate extra utilities components or custom variants for example if you have used Daisy UI or flowy before you had to manually import the plugin right here like this however some plugins like shn for example handle this automatically so when you install Shaden in Tailwind version 3 the CLI configures everything
(02:15) for you and if you check your Tailwind doc config.js file afterward you'll see that the necessary Imports were added automatically like this line here for example or that line but but in Tailwind version 4 plug-in Imports now work differently instead of adding them to the Tailwind doc config.
(02:39) js file you now import plugins directly in your Global CSS file in my case that's the index.css and you can do that by adding the following line at the top of this file add plugin and then for example DAC UI like that of course you still need to install Daisy UI first for this to work and and also make sure that you use the latest version Daisy UI 5 just launched its public beta with the stable version dropping on March first and that's the version you should use with Tailwind version 4 you'll find the new installation guide as well as all other
(03:15) important links in the description box down below also shetsen doesn't fully support Tailwind CSS version 4 yet but they are already working on an update there is a workaround if you really need it but I would recommend waiting for the official update and the new documentation which shouldn't be too long moving on there is also the prefix option it allows you to add a custom prefix to all of Tailwinds generated utility classes that means if you add that line here in your Tailwind doc config.js file you then have to use this
(03:52) prefix uh in my case tww Das for all Tailwind classes so instead of class name text orange 500 I would now have to say class name tww d text orange 500 but in Tailwind version 4 prefixes are no longer set in JavaScript files instead you now also configure them directly in your CSS file you just need to add The Following part at the very top where you import Tailwind CSS you have to say prefix and in here here you say for example tww like that one major change here previously many uses prefix classes with tww Dash like I just showed you but this
(04:44) is no longer possible with version 4 now prefixes must be separated by a column that means in my example the prefix is tww so I have to add this prefix followed by a column to all my Tailwind class names in this project like that and now let's move on to the theme section this is where you add all your customizations in Tailwind version 3 anything defined above the extend section here completely replaces Tailwinds default settings for the specified keys so the screens key right here for example replaces all default
(05:28) break points with these three new ones that I defined meaning these will now be the only break points available in this project if you use the colors key here it will completely replace Tailwinds default color palette for this project so make sure that you only use keys outside the extend section if you know exactly what you need for your project most of the time you probably just want to extend Tailwinds buil-in Styles or override just a specific color or font size and for that you can use the extend section down here with this
(06:10) part here we add the color Twitter blue but without affecting the default color palette so we're simply adding a new color and with this part here we override the color option orange 500 but again This only affects this specific shade not the entire color palette because we Define it inside the extend section in version four all of this customization now goes into a global CSS file so let me show you how to achieve the same customization with the new Tailwind version for that we navigate into the top level CSS file index. CSS
(06:53) this has to be the same file where we also import Tailwind CSS and in here we can now add the a theme directive with the theme directive we Define special CSS variables that are also called theme variables and in here we can now add D- breakpoint DSM copy this line two times change this to MD for medium and LG for large then we copy the values from the project with Tailwind version three into the project with Tailwind version 4 and save and since the theme directive kind of works like the extend section in the Tailwind doc config.js file we just
(07:40) redefined those three breakpoints uh but did not replace all default break points with that however if we want to achieve uh exactly that in version four we need to add uh we need to set the entire name space to initial so we would need to add Das Dash breakpoint Das asterisk initial like that and now we get the same results as we get with the screens key in the Tailwind version 3 project so this now brings the same results as that next we also want to achieve this and that's also pretty easy if you want to add a color like Twitter blue in
(08:29) version 4 you just have to add D- color- Twitter blue and then add the hex code like so and if you want to overwrite a specific color option just add D- color Das let's say orange 500 and again add the hex code like that and that's it so basically if you create a variable in here and the name is already taken you overwrite the value of it and if the name is not taken you create a new theme variable one last important change that you need to know is that the names have changed so in version three it was called screens in version four it's
(09:17) called Break points in version three it's called colors and in version four it's called color and so on I'll put a link to an overview of the name spaces in the description box down below that's it for this video thanks for watching destroy the like button and I'll see you in the next video ciao

(96) Tailwind v4 Is FINALLY Out – Here’s What’s New (and how to migrate!) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud913ekwAOQ

Transcript:
(00:00) Tailwind V4 has been in the works for over a year but as of today it is finally out it has a lot of awesome new features and changes even some breaking ones too so in the end I'll show you how I upgraded my app with over 130 Tailwind components this is truly a huge update so let's take a look let's start off with my favorite change and that is that the configuration files are moving away from JavaScript and just all being done in a CSS file this includes using CSS variables for configuring Your Design tokens defining custom utilities
(00:30) variants and a whole load more this is all done with the new at theme directive that influences which utility classes exist in your project you can see the available name spaces on that documentation but there's so many of them that you can customize this makes it super easy to pass things that were previously in your JavaScript config to other libraries like motion and just plain JavaScript as well as it's now all done with a CSS variable another thing you may remember from the Tailwind config is the content array this is
(00:57) where you had to tell Tailwind where it was being used they have removed this entirely now and it's all done automatically for you even includes support for ignoring files that are in your G ignore if you do ever need to explicitly add a source that's been excluded though you can always add it in with the new at source directive right in your CSS file other awesome directives for configuration include the app plug-in one to add in third party plugins like Tailwind animate at custom variant they have a new at config
(01:22) directive in case you do still need to use the old Javascript file and they've even removed the at Tailwind directive as you now just use the CSS import one finally instead of using the layer directive to extend utilities like we had to do previously there is now a new at utility one since we no longer have JavaScript configuration files options like container with sensor and padding that's all been moved directly into the CSS file with just pure CSS they've even made a small change to how the default border color worked changing it to just
(01:49) use current color so you can even add something if you want backwards compatibility they've also change the pre-fight placeholder color as well to just use 50% opacity of the current color other FS might change for you include the post CSS one in fact they've streamlined the whole setup process now you no longer need extra plugins like post CSS Import Auto prefixer they have a first-party one that will do it all for you even better if you use V now you can actually get rid of postcss entirely with the Tailwind V plugin combine that
(02:18) with no longer needing to set up the content array and you can now use Tailwind with pretty much zero configuration let's talk about some Modern CSS features that are now coming to Tailwind they've got native Cascade layers they've also got registered C properties which is going to make it possible to animate things like gradients and it also improves performance on large Pages they've got color mix which lets you adjust the opacity of any color value including CSS variables and current color and they've also got logical properties as well
(02:44) which simplifies right to left support and reduces the size of your generated CSS the default color palette got an upgrade moving from RGB to OK lch this is to take advantage of a wider gamut to make the colors more Vivid in places where they were previously limited by that RGB color space container query support has also been merged in so you no longer need the Tailwind container queries plugin and that comes with support for Max width container queries as well we got some new apis for 3D transforms as well like rotate scale
(03:13) translate perspective and tons more there's new gradient features like linear gradient angles which actually came with the renaming of background gradient to background linear there's gradient interpolation modifiers and what's really cool is there is new background conic and background radial utilities that's why they rename the background gradient to background linear there's a new starting variant which adds support for the CSS starting style feature this makes it possible to transition element properties when an
(03:39) element is first displayed there's a new KN variant as well which finally adds support for the CSS not pseudo class as well as negating media queries and support queries that's already a whole load of new features but let me quick fire some more before we move on to what's changed there's new inser Shadow and inser ring utilities New Field sizing utilities for auto resizing text areas without need of JavaScript there's new color scheme utilities there's new font stretch utilities which will allow you to tweak variable fonts that support
(04:06) widths there's a new inert variant there's new nth variants there's a new in variant as well which is actually similar to group but without the need for the group class the support for popover open and finally there is a new descendant variant for styling all descendant elements this should be used as an absolute Last Resort when you can't control The Descendants please don't go around throwing this Intel when code bases it'll be an absolute Nightmare and it takes away the magic of hwind being localized another favorite
(04:32) change or new feature of mine is they've actually simplified the way utilities and variants work they're now going to allow them to accept certain types of arbitrary values without configuration or the arbitrary value Syntax for example you can create grids of any size now you can use Boolean data attributes without the square brackets and spacing utilities can now also use any value which is then going to be calculated based on your spacing variable now I'm finally near the end of this change log there's just a few more changes from V3
(04:59) that you're going to need to look out for the first one is utilities like Shadow ring and backdrop have all been renamed to make them more consistent and predictable they've also changed the variable syntax from square brackets to parentheses to remove ambiguity deprecated utilities have finally been removed entirely so you can't use them stacked variants have gone from right to left to left to right to look more like CSS syntax and the hover variant now only applies when the primary input device supports hover this may have an
(05:27) implication on mobile if you've previously used hover on tap but don't worry you can go ahead and get the old Behavior back with some CSS you can also no longer disable core plugins and they actually recommend using the variable function over the theme one now if you do need the theme function where variables aren't supported like media queries you should use the CSS variable name instead of the Old Dot notation I think that's everything that you need to know about what's been added and changed in Tailwind V4 so let's take a look at
(05:53) the upgrade process so my project here is a Shaden like component library that I created has over 130 components all using Tailwind so I'm very curious to see how it migrates now if you've used Shad CM before this setup should look quite familiar to you but you can see in my Tailwind config here I have support for dark mode I'm using that content array which we now know they're getting rid of and then I have some settings on the theme for container with center and padding which they also got rid of because we can't use the JavaScript
(06:19) options and then we have extend where I add in my own semantic colors that use CSS variables and they're all defined over in my CSS file and then we also have things like the font family border radius key frames and animations and then we also have the Tailwind CSS animate plugin there as well so it's actually quite a complex config that is going to need to migrate over to just purely using CSS lucky for us they provide a handy tool that promises to do all of this in one command I'm going to go ahead and run npx at Tailwind CSS
(06:49) upgrade let's hit enter and see what this does so it only took a couple of seconds and you can see it lists out all of the steps that it took it's migrated over my JavaScript config files it's migrated some of the templates the stylesheets the postcss configuration and then updated my dependencies overall in my project then it changed 137 files now remember about 130 of those are components that I have that all use tailn so I'm curious to see what it had to change in each of them you can see that it changed the Tailwind config here
(07:17) it deleted it and hopefully it's moved it over to the global. CSS file now there we go as you can see it's got rid of the Tailwind directive in favor of this new at import one we're using at plugin for Tailwind CSS anime at custom variant for dark mode and then finally we have this add theme directive where we're defining the theme so we've got D- color border which was a custom color I wanted to add and that's just using my old Border variable as well so obviously didn't want to modify that in the future I'd probably come in here and actually
(07:43) just change this to the value itself without using a variable that then points to another variable but it's nice to know the migration tool doesn't want to touch what we already had scrolling down then we can see it's moved in the key frames as well that were also in my config the font family the Border radius it's got the animations it's got the utility of the container as well and then it's also added in a border color thing here that adds in that backwards compatibility that I mentioned earlier and then another utility as well in the
(08:10) post CSS file then you can see it got rid of Auto prefixer and also the old Tailwind CSS plugin and it's added in the new one of at Tailwind css/css which is going to have all of the behavior that we need for Tailwind looking through the rest of the 10030 files I can see it's just made some of the small changes that I mentioned earlier like this one here it's got rid of the square brackets notation for variables and it's moved it over to the new parentheses one and then we scroll down as well you can see for data hovered where it was an
(08:37) arbitary value now that it's just a Boolean we can just do data- hovered you can see here as well it renamed outline-solid none to outline-solid hidden this is because in V4 they realized that V3 was a bit confusing where outline-solid none wasn't actually setting the outline sty To None it was just setting it as an invisible outline so now outline hidden has the old behavior and outline none actually sets the outline style as none now there we go I think that is everything I wanted to show you about Tailwind V4 as I said it's a big change I'm sure
(09:04) there's even more subtle details if you want to check out the release notes I'll leave them Link in the description down below to me these changes are all in the right direction so let me know what you think in the comments below while you're there like And subscribe and as always see you in the next one [Music]

(96) Tailwind V4 is STABLE! What’s New & How to Upgrade! - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9SzYhN9FpM

Transcript:
(00:00) Tailwind version 4 is stable and this is the biggest release so far it is much faster and there is no more Tailwind config file first check out these benchmarks for full build it's almost four times faster which is really impressive and Tailwind update I still cannot believe is here is the CSS first configuration so that's the biggest change in this release and they're totally getting rid of the Tailwind config file and they're going full CSS and this CSS configuration is allowing us to do just about everything that we
(00:42) could do in the old Tailwind configuration file so we can now add animations key frames and everything exactly the same like before but this time through CSS configuration and if we check all the features in this new release we can see that they were building towards the better performance and I think they did it because here we can see the full builds are up to five times faster although there we saw four and incremental builds over 100 times faster and then they call this one designed for the modern web which is
(01:16) basically they added Cascade layers and registered custom properties with at property and the color mix which is really a great addition also to this release then we have simplified installation fewer dependency zero configuration we are going to cover that one later we are going to upgrade the nextjs project from version 3 to version 4 and they created the CLI which is really awesome and it's really easy to do that then they created the tight integration for maximum performance with vit and vit is a French word it means
(01:47) quick if you're calling it white you're doing it wrong then we have automatic content detection all of template files are discovered automatically with no configuration required so that is awesome even less things for us to do then we have built-in UT support no additional tooling necessary for bundling multiple CSS files CSS first configuration we covered that one and I'm still surprised they really did it we are getting rid of the tailin config file then we have CSS team variables so all of our design tokens exposed as
(02:21) native CSS variables so we can access them anywhere awesome then we have Dynamic utility values and variance so we can stop guessing what are we putting for our padding for example if you have like padding 12 then padding 14 padding 16 this one is going to receive also 13 15 Etc so we cannot make a mistake and that it doesn't work so this is really nice I mean this was handled before by different dependencies but now we can just rely on Tailwind itself then we have the modernized P3 color palette redesigned more Vivid color palette we
(03:04) can check it out so here we can see that they upgraded the entire default palette from RGB to this one I don't know how to pronounce this uch and taking advantage of the wider gamut to make the colors more Vivid I think this is also a great addition to this release and then we have the container queries so first class apis for styling elements based on their container size no plugins required they said here no plugins required because for this one we were using the dependency I think it is called Tailwind container queries so we can get rid of
(03:42) that one also they have it now inside the tailwind and then we have this new 3D transform utilities I really love this update so now we can basically we have things like rotate X rotate y scale Zed translate Zed and we can create something like this for this one also we were using different libraries so now we can do it with Tailwind I think it really looks awesome and we can create also look at this sphere this is really awesome thing that we can do with Tailwind only and I think this is going to bring bunch of new like UI libraries
(04:20) and different things like in shed Cen maybe for some 3D objects we are going to see how is that one going to look then we have the expanded grade radiant apis and we saw it so those were those spheres radial and conic gradients and this is also awesome a starting style support a new variant where we can use to create enter and exit transitions so here we can see in the example that we have this transition discrete and if I refresh my screen for example you'll see that we have some like small transition so here we have opacity zero but we
(04:57) could here create something like some F in or something like that so this is working in Tailwind without any JavaScript so I think this one is also a great addition and we have a not variant so we can say if something is not happening put this kind of styling we didn't have that I think this one is going to be useful we'll see especially for groups and something like that and even more new utilities and variants including support for color scheme field sizing and complex Shadows like inert so we can see also the examples we have
(05:32) inser Shadow inser ring field sizing and bunch of new stuff here we are going to test everything on some of our future projects I'm not going to do it now so those are basically all the new features inside of this release and now we can upgrade the orcish AI nextjs project from version three to version four and let's see how hard is it going to be so on this same page we have here the upgrade guide here it is and we're going to that one so here we can see that they created the new CLI for upgrading from version three to version 4 and this one
(06:16) should do the vast majority of the heavy lifting for us so basically this command should upgrade everything and everything should work with the new Tailwind version 4 configuration so we have here the orish AI nextjs framework it's built in shed CN and it's nextjs 15 and we are going to put in this command inside of our terminal and we're going to see if that's going to work so I'm just typing it in npx Tailwind I just don't need this dollar sign here Tailwind CSS upgrade next and now something is happening searching for CSS files okay
(06:58) so it's linked our tail Tailwind config TS and it's putting it inside the global. CSS migrating all the JavaScript configuration files everything again from the configuration configuration and it migrated everything to Global CSS then we installed package St in CSS post CSS and removing Auto prefixer migrated post CSS configuration and everything should be upgraded so let's see if everything is working so first thing I'm going to do is to go to orish andj framework and refresh and everything seems in place let's see let's try it out so give me 10
(07:42) orish names if anything is out of the ordinary but everything seems normal I mean this is a simple project so it's not something full of some animations or something but it has shed CN so I thought maybe it's not going to work let's see here for buying tokens everything looks okay okay let's see the code so here in cursor if we go to all the change files we can see bunch of things here happening so T.
(08:27) C config.lua in CSS and tail CSS animate so this one is new and this one is pretty much everything the same color border primary Etc but here it is here we have our accordion animation so this one is coming from shed Cen then we have our key frames so everything that we see here was inside of the Tailwind configuration file and we can see it here so here in the old Stalin file that is now deleted we can check our animation ation and key frames here it is for example so this one this entire key frames object is now moved here so
(09:09) everything is inside the CSS file and here is the animation so we have here animation object accordion down accordion up and we saw that one here awesome so this one is really impressive and we can see also that the upgrade script changed some of our shedy and files so here is badge for example let's see what it added so here we had inline Flex item Center rounded full border everything is pretty much the same font semi bolt transition colors so here instead of focus outline-solid none now it is focus outline-solid hidden okay so that's the
(09:49) difference then we have the button and here also some Shadow SM Shadow XS Shadow XS so it is giving some Shadow properties now then we have the card what we have here also for shadows and yeah bunch of Shadows here but it is a good thing that this one is happening automatically with their CLI script and everything is being updated and I just want to see package.
(10:21) json so here okay so tail CSS to 4.0 then this Auto prefixer is totally gone and that's it from here so we saw that one also on the terminal when we migrated to version 4 and that is pretty much it so I don't have to do basically anything I can now just commit everything and push and it is going to work with Tailwind version 4 I hope you enjoyed the video if you have any questions for me you have the comments or join the Discord Channel we have a Tavern there we are sitting by the fire and talking about bunch of stuff so join Jo the cord subscribe
